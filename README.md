# Quiz-App-Flutter

## About
````
Quiz App is a cross platform application build in flutter. 
As like any other quiz app, it also allows the user to check their
knowledge of certain topic and score them accordingly.
App is built to provide the features of user signup and login along with google login. 
App fetches the questions and answers directly from the firebase and 
also posts the score of user in the firebase. This helps to keep track of 
user performance..

## Quick Note
````
This app is still in the late development phase and thus there are a few bugs and logics to be fixed.
As soon as all the bugs are fixed, the app will be made available here in this github repository
and also in playstore, if everything goes well...
I'll try to build the apk and link it here, if any one desires to check the app.
Apk link will be uploaded once I complete the basic app requirements..

## Credits
````
The app is inspired from the designs available in dribble and printerest and thus the UI credit goes 
to the designer themselves. I'll also add the link to the UI I have implemented as credit to the designer.
Links will soon be added, atleast before the completion of app..
